Here it is the one of the useful algo as of comapring with bubblesort 
there are lot of swappings present there so here we have only single iterations
swap.

here mainly we can first find min/max element and for min it will place at leftmost 
andfor max it will place in rightmost

Selection Sort Algorithm: Detailed but Concise Overview

Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, for descending sort) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element, gradually growing the sorted section.

	1.	How it works:
	•	Iterate over the list, and for each position, find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list.
	•	Swap this smallest element with the first element of the unsorted part.
	•	After each pass, the sorted section of the list grows by one element, moving from left to right.
	•	Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.
	2.	Time Complexity:
	•	Worst, Best, and Average Case: O(n²), where n is the number of elements, because each pass requires searching through the remaining unsorted elements to find the minimum.
	3.	Space Complexity:
	•	O(1), as it sorts the list in place with no additional memory required, aside from a few variables for swapping.
	4.	Characteristics:
	•	Not stable: Does not maintain the relative order of equal elements unless explicitly modified.
	•	In-place and easy to understand, but inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.

Selection Sort is generally used for small datasets or when memory is limited and simplicity is preferred over efficiency.
